I will provide you with a list of URLs along with their titles and description. For each URL, analyze whether the
content has educational value. Consider a URL as educational if it provides useful information, explanations,
knowledge, or insights related to academic, technical, scientific, or practical topics.
Personal long-form or blog posts should always be considered educational.
If there are multiple very similar URLs with similar content only flag a maximum of one as educational.

Response Format Guidelines:

Respond in JSON format, with each entry including "url", "title", "educational (true/false)", and "summary".
If the content is not educational, include "reason" instead of "summary". Format your response as follows:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "example.com",
      "title": "Example Title",
      "educational": true,
      "summary": "A brief summary of the educational content found at the URL.",
    },
    {
      "url": "example2.com",
      "title": "Example Title 2",
      "educational": false,
      "reason": "The content is promotional without educational insights."
    }
  ]
}
